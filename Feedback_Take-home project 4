Hi Duc,

Congratulations! You have done a good job in the Take-home project 4 by answering all the questions.

One thing you may want to note is to have a quick look at the dataset before you load it. 

If the dataset has its first row for column names then you may want to set header = True.

Also, in your github repositories, if possile include the dataset that you are using so whoever wants to review your project can have access to the dataset.

Your score for the Take-home project 4 is 9 over 10. Howver, due to your late submission your final score is 7/10.

Should you have any questions regarding the feedback, please let know.

Thanks,

Quynh
